Designed to see if you can draw things.

Create and draw three objects. 
Examples are sphere, star, points (at least 1500), square, triangle, trapezoid, lines (at least 6), any kind of polygon, and etc. Stick with 2D.
Use mouse controls: left click cycles through drawing the different objects and right click to exit the program.

Use different GLenum modes aka gl primitives along with GL_QUAD and etc.

Theme for the Course
"When in Doubt Google It!"

Good Luck.
